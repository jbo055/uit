# 1) File Handling:
# try, exception ( different exceptions), finally
# FileNotFoundException, ValueError, IndexoutofBound
# file usage with exceptions, open()

# 2) Data Structures, Set, Tuple, Dict,
# Immutable
# Set: no duplicates
# ordered and unordered
# .get()

# 3) Recursion, combination with sorting algorithm or trees or traversing
# how recursion is made and how it is done,

# recursion as a tool with performance... complexity O(n) I(n^2) O(log n)

# 4) Sorting: Combination with other aspects .. file handling,
# trees, graphs... complexity and performance
# solutions with and without object oriented programming..

# 5) Stacks LIFO FIFO queues
# append.. pop LIFO
# collections

# 6) Binary Trees .. general structure.. object oriented, Recursion
# traversing .. post order .. pre order.. treenode, right, left
# how traversing a tree is combined with sorting

# 7) dictionaries Hashing .. how advanced hashing is working
# general structure.. easy hashing .. but also advanced hashing

# 8) Graphs.. in combination with trees or traversing.. Recursion
# how to build a graph .. dictionary .. performance
# how to analyze the structure of the graph (DFS, BFS).. neighbors visited
# edges.. usage of clear variable names
